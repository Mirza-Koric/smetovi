# Smetovi.ba
This is the repository for the smetovi.ba project, an open-source website for the mountain Smetovi near Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This is a community effort developed with Astro and deployed to Cloudflare Pages. 
You can find the link to the Figma design here: https://www.figma.com/design/nvFlshRNkF69E737MhWAeX/Smetovi?node-id=0-1&t=Po3U28YpSKfjIcCc-1

Below are some instructions generated by the Astro CLI as part of the blog template.

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
